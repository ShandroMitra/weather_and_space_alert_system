WEATHER AND SPACE ALERT SYSTEM
==============================

Overview
--------
This project integrates data from the Open-Meteo API and NASA's Near Earth Object (NEO) API to monitor and generate alerts for weather and space events.

The system performs the following tasks:

Weather Alert System:
- Fetches weather data from Open-Meteo API
- Cleans and transforms the data
- Validates and loads the data into a database
- Detects extreme weather conditions and sends alert emails

Space Alert System:
- Fetches asteroid and near-earth object data from NASA NEO API
- Cleans, transforms, and validates the data
- Loads data into the database
- Detects potential asteroid threats and sends alert emails
